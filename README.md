optimize
========

Optimization web page where users can visualize different optimization algorithms.

- Currently runs a Genetic algorithm on a web worker and generates a visualization of the change in the objective function.

- Current optimization problem: (sin x)^2 + (sin y)^2 + x^2+ y^2, -8<x<8, -8<y<8

- Currently has preset encoding, number of samples, etc.

Future plans:
- Let user change all the settings
- Add different optimization workers
- More visualization options.
